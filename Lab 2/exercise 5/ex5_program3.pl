#this reads in a filename that the user types at the terminal 
#and then reads all the lines of that file.

# As a line is read, it checks if the line has the word ACCESSION
# followed by a space followed later by an accession number.
#It grabs the accession number if so. An accession number is
#a string that has either 1 or 2 capital letters, followed by
#a run of between 3 to 7 digitis. After the digits should
#be either a space, a comma, a period, 
#a semi-colon, a colon, or a question mark. 

# Write a file with several lines in it, some that have the word ACCESSION
# and then an accession number in it, and some that don't.

#Name the file yourself, and input that filename when the
#program executes.

# Note that the program right now will only report one ACCESSION number
# per line. It should be the first ACCESSION number on the line. See if you
# can modify the program to find the last ACCESSION number on the line. Later
# we will further modify the program to report all the ACCESSION numbers on
# the line.
