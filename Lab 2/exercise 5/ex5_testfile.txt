The primary ACCESSION number might be something like U63121 or maybe the ACCESSION is FA10325, or the ACCESSION is PQ3469. I don't know what the sequences are for these numbers. Maybe they are atcGGGAcatcaGGG or maybe not. Is this another ACCESSION number NO9978 or is it a telephone number. Perhaps XYzCATCGGAPQ is a DNA string? What will the program do with it? Is that what you want it to do?
