# As a simple modification exercise, remove the characters \n
# from the first line and rerun the program, noting how the output changes.

# Original
print "Welcome to Perl\n";
print "TATA is a box\n";

# Without newlines

print "Welcome to Perl";
print "TATA is a box";

# Then try the program with the second \n also removed, and finally
# with the first one in but the second removed. 

# Try inserting \t just after the open quote in one of the lines,
# to see the effect. Then insert it at different places in the lines,
# and note the effect. 

# Next, replace the double quotes with single quotes.
# Next, try the program with no quotes at all.
# Try to explain.
